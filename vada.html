        <h2>Ingredients:</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>1 cup urad dal</h2></li>
                <li><h2>2 green chilli (finely chopped)</h2></li>
                    <li><h2>1 inch ginger (finely chopped)</h2></li>
                        <li><h2>few curry leaves (finely chopped)</h2></li>
                            <li><h2>2 tbsp coriander (finely chopped)</h2></li>
                                <li><h2>1 tbsp dry coconut</h2></li>
                                    <li><h2>pinch of hing / asafoetida</h2></li>
                                        <li><h2>2 tbsp rice flour</h2></li>
                                            <li><h2>½ tsp salt</h2></li>
                                                <li><h2>oil for deep frying</h2></li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>firstly, in soak 1 cup urad dal in enough water for 3 hours. do not over soak, as the vadas will absorb oil.
            drain off the water and grind to fine fluffy paste adding water as required. i have added 4 tbsp of water to make smooth thick paste.
            transfer the urad dal paste into large mixing bowl.<br> beat and mix the batter in circular motion till they turn light. this helps to incorporate air into batter and make medu vada soft and fluffy.
            further add 1 inch ginger, few curry leaves, 2 tbsp coriander, 1 tbsp dry coconut, pinch of hing, 2 tbsp rice flour and ½ tsp salt.
            mix the batter well with the help of spoon.<br>
            heat the oil in large kadai. wet your hands with enough water and take a small ball sized dough and make it round.
            now slowly shape the edges and make a hole at the centre like you prepared in bread vada.
            drop the vada in oil and deep fry the medu vada on medium flame.<br>
            fry on both sides till they turn golden brown and crisp.
            finally, serve hot medu vada prepared in mixi with chutney or sambar of your choice.</h2></p>
