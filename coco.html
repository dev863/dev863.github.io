        <p><h2>Take the freshly grated coconut in a chutney grinder jar or a small grinder jar.
            Then add the green chili and ginger.
            Next add the roasted chana dal. Also add salt as per taste. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons water.
            Grind to a smooth consistency. If unable to grind or the chutney looks thick, then you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water.
            Remove the chutney in a heatproof bowl like a steel bowl or a pyrex bowl.Heat oil in a small pan. Add the mustard seeds. 
            When the mustard seeds begin to splutter, add the cumin seeds and urad dal. Fry till the urad dal starts to become golden and aromatic.
            Then add the curry leaves, red chili and asafoetida. 
            Fry for a couple of seconds till the curry leaves become crisp and the red chillies change color making sure that the curry leaves and chilies do not get burnt.
            Switch off the heat and immediately pour the tempering on the chutney in the bowl.
            Mix the tempering mixture very well.
            Serve coconut chutney with idli, dosa, vada, pongal or pakoda of your choice.</h2></p>
